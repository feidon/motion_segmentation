## Pytorch Implementation of Unsupervised Depth and Motion Learning.

This project is an unofficial pytorch implementation of [depth and motion planning](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/depth_and_motion_learning).

This project is based on the paper [Unsupervised Monocular Depth Learning in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16404)
